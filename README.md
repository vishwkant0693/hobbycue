"Thanks for the opportunity! 
I'm Vishwkant,
A ReactJS developer with a fresh perspective and a hunger for learning, 
I recently completed a 9-month full-stack developer course from DUCAT Pitampura and building a strong foundation in modern web technologies.
Prior to this, I gained hands-on experience during a 2-month internship/training at Krenai IT Solutions, where I got a taste of real-world project dynamics.
Excited to contribute my skills to innovative projects."
